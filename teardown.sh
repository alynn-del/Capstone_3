# teardown.sh -- deletes every AWS resource this lesson creates.
#
# RDS and OpenSearch both bill continuously while running (unlike Lambda,
# which only bills for actual invocations) -- run this as soon as you're
# done testing, not at the end of the day.
#
# SAFETY: defaults to a dry run. Pass --confirm to actually delete anything.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./teardown.sh --name amw              # dry run, lists what would be deleted
#   ./teardown.sh --name amw --confirm    # actually deletes
#
# Replace "amw" with whatever <yourname> suffix you used when creating
# these resources in Parts 3-5 of the lesson.
